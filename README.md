# anchor-lending

anchor-lending is an anchor CPI client for any program that implements or extends the instruction interface found in the spl token lending program. Currently, it provides an idiomatic interface for `DepositReserveLiquidity`, `RedeemReserveCollateral`, `RefreshReserve`, and `FlashLoan`. It aims to eventually be a complete implementation so PRs are always welcome :)
